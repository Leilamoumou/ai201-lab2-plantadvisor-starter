# Spec: Tool Functions

**File:** `tools.py`
**Status:** `get_seasonal_conditions` — Pre-implemented, read through. `lookup_plant` — complete spec fields before implementing.

---

## Purpose

These two functions are the tools the agent can call. They retrieve structured data from the local plant database and seasonal data files and return it to the agent loop, which passes it to the LLM as context for generating a response.

---

## Function 1: `lookup_plant()`

### Input / Output Contract

**Inputs:**

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `plant_name` | `str` | The plant name as entered by the user or chosen by the LLM — may be any casing, common name, scientific name, or alias |

**Output:** `dict`

When the plant is **found**, return:
```python
{"found": True, "plant": <the full plant dict from _plant_db>}
```

When the plant is **not found**, return:
```python
{"found": False, "name": <normalized input>, "message": <helpful string>}
```

---

### Design Decisions

*Complete the two blank fields below before writing code. The others are pre-filled for you.*

---

#### Input normalization

Strip leading/trailing whitespace and convert to lowercase before any comparison.

```python
normalized = plant_name.strip().lower()
```

---

#### Search order

Search in this order: direct key → display name → aliases. Keys are the fastest
lookup (O(1) dict access), so check those first. Display names are the next most
likely match for clean user input. Aliases are the broadest net, so they go last.

```
1. Direct key match: normalized in _plant_db
2. Display name match: plant["display_name"].lower() == normalized
3. Alias match: normalized in [alias.lower() for alias in plant["aliases"]]
```

---

#### Alias matching approach

*Aliases are stored as a list of strings. How will you check if the normalized input matches any alias in the list? Write your approach in pseudocode or plain English.*

```
Each plant's aliases are stored as a list of strings, so  the whole list turned into lower case leads to a single
comprehension — aliases = [a.lower() for a in plant.get("aliases", [])] — and
then test membership with `normalized in aliases`. Using .get("aliases", []) means a
plant with no aliases key just yields an empty list instead of raising KeyError, and
lowercasing both sides keeps the match case-insensitive.
```

---

#### Not-found message

*When a plant isn't found, the agent will read your message and use it to decide what to tell the user. Write the exact string you'll return — make it useful to the agent, not just to a human reading logs.*

```
No plant named '{plant_name}' was found in the database. The available plants are:
{comma-separated list of display names}. Suggest the closest match or let the user
know you only have care info for the listed plants.
```

---

#### Implementation Notes

*Fill this in after implementing and running the app.*

**Test: does `"devil's ivy"` return the pothos entry?**
```
Yes, "devil's ivy".strip().lower() stays "devil's ivy" (apostrophe preserved), and
the alias check lowercases each stored alias, so it matches pothos's "Devil's Ivy"
alias. 
```

**Test: does `"SNAKE PLANT"` return the snake plant entry?**
```
Yes, normalized becomes "snake plant", which matches either the dict key or the
lowercased display_name. 
```

**One edge case you discovered while implementing:**
```
Empty or whitespace-only input: " ".strip().lower() becomes "", which won't match any key, display_name, or alias, which leads it to fall straight through to the not-found
branch and returns the full available-plants list. The function never crashes on a blank query, and it just degrades to provide what it does have rather than adjusting.
```

## Function 2: `get_seasonal_conditions()`

### Input / Output Contract

**Inputs:**

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `season` | `str \| None` | One of `"spring"`, `"summer"`, `"fall"`, `"winter"`, or `None` to auto-detect |

**Output:** `dict`

The full season dict from `_season_data`, plus one additional field:

| Added field | Type | Value |
|-------------|------|-------|
| `"detected_season"` | `bool` | `True` if auto-detected from the month; `False` if season was passed as an argument |

---

### Design Decisions

*This function is pre-implemented — read through these fields and the code before working on `lookup_plant`.*

---

#### Auto-detection logic

When `season` is `None`, get the current calendar month with `datetime.now().month`
and look it up in the `_MONTH_TO_SEASON` dict, which maps month numbers to season strings.

```python
current_month = datetime.now().month
season_key = _MONTH_TO_SEASON[current_month]
```

---

#### Season validation

If the caller passes an invalid season string (e.g., `"monsoon"`), the function
falls back to auto-detection — same as if `None` were passed. The `VALID_SEASONS`
set acts as the gate:

```python
VALID_SEASONS = {"spring", "summer", "fall", "winter"}
if season and season.lower() in VALID_SEASONS:
    ...  # use provided season
else:
    ...  # auto-detect
```

---

#### Return structure

The full season dict from `_season_data`, plus a `detected_season` boolean. Example for spring:

```python
{
    "season": "spring",
    "watering": "Increase watering frequency as plants break dormancy ...",
    "fertilizing": "Resume feeding with a balanced fertilizer ...",
    "light": "Days are lengthening — move plants closer to windows ...",
    "pests": "Watch for spider mites and aphids as temperatures rise ...",
    "detected_season": True   # True = auto-detected; False = caller specified
}
```

---

#### Implementation Notes

*Fill this in after testing.*

**Test: does calling with `season=None` return the correct season for the current month?**
```
Current month: [month]
Expected season: [season]
Returned season: [season]
```

**Test: does calling with `season="winter"` return winter data regardless of the current month?**
```
[yes / no]
```
